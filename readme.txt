Surviv.io: 112 Version

Based off the browser game surviv.io, this 112 Version is a game where you play as a sentient circle,
trying to survive against other sentient circles. As your circle, you can move around and pick up
items for the battle ahead, including weapons, ammos, and health! Periodically, hordes of zombie circles
will appear and try to attack you. If you kill them, you will gain score. However, these zombies learn
the best behavior after each wave and will attack in larger numbers and with refined strategies.
Run around, kill enemies, and loot as much as you can before your inevitable death!

Note: Solo vs. Squad does nothing right now, both will result in a single player gamemode.
